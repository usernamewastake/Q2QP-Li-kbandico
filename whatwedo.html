                    <h2>Initiatives</h2>
                    <p>Climate change poses the greatest threat to the most vulnerable who are often the ones contributing the least to its escalation. The global climate crisis affects everything that CARE does and threatens our vision of a world of hope, tolerance and social justice where poverty has been overcome and people live in dignity and security. As the breadth and impact of the climate emergency are expected to worsen in the coming future, CARE must do all it can to ensure that our actions are part of a global, urgent, effective and equitable response.</p>
